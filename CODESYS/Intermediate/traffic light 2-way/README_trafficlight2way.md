üö¶ **2-Way Traffic Light Control System (North-South / East-West)**

This program simulates a 2-way traffic control system with timed light transitions for North-South and East-West directions using structured text and visualization in CODESYS.

üß© **Logic Description**

_**Key Behaviors:**_

- The system starts with North-South (NS) Green, and East-West (EW) Red.
- After 15 seconds, NS Green switches to NS Yellow.
- After 5 seconds, NS Yellow switches to NS Red, and EW Green is activated.
- After 15 seconds, EW Green turns into EW Yellow.
- After 5 seconds, EW Yellow ends, and NS Red is cleared ‚Äî resetting the cycle.
- The cycle continues as long as start is active and stop is not pressed.

_**Timer Logic::**_

- A TON timer (traffic_timer) controls phase timing.
- elapsed_time := traffic_timer.ET tracks time progression in the current phase.
- The timer resets after every transition to manage the next timed phase correctly.

**üñ• Visualization**

The simulation includes a user-friendly visual layout featuring:
- LED indicators for each light: red, yellow, and green for both NS and EW directions.
- Start/Stop push buttons to control the signal loop.
- A simple compass layout to denote direction.
- Lights change dynamically based on logic, allowing easy real-time observation.
