🚦 **4-Way Traffic Signal Logic (PLC-Based)**

This project simulates a 4-way traffic signal system using Structured Text (ST) programming in CODESYS. It handles the traffic flow for north-south and east-west directions, including straight and left/right turns, along with a pedestrian crossing phase.

🧩 **Logic Description**

The logic mimics a real-world 4-way signal system with a stage-based flow using timers and control flags. It includes:

- Green, Yellow, and Red signal phases for all four directions
- Separate left and right turn handling
- Pedestrian walk signal phase integrated safely between vehicle cycles
- A finite state machine (FSM) approach to transition between stages

⏱️ **Signal Sequence (Simplified Flow)**

1. North-South straight green phase
2. North-South straight yellow
3. East-West straight green
4. East-West straight yellow
5. Pedestrian crossing (First)
6. North-South left/right turn green
7. North-South left/right turn yellow
8. East-West left/right turn green
9. East-West left/right turn yellow
10. Pedestrian crossing (Second)
11. Cycle resets to North-South straight green

Each stage transition is timer-driven to maintain realistic delays between changes.

🚶 **Pedestrian Logic**

- Pedestrian signals are active during safe vehicle red-light intervals
- Transitions through red → green → yellow → red
- Walk time: 10 seconds, with yellow starting after 7 seconds
