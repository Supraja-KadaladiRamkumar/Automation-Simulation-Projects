‚öôÔ∏è **Structured Text (ST) Basics: Loops, Conditionals & Expressions**

This Structured Text (ST) code demonstrates various foundational programming constructs used in PLC programming via CODESYS, including arithmetic expressions, **FOR**, **WHILE**, and **REPEAT** loops, as well as **IF-ELSIF** and **CASE** conditional statements. The example focuses on showcasing syntax and structure, and does not return a visible output unless explicitly configured to.

üß© **Logic Description**

- FOR Loop for Multiplication
- IF-ELSE Example
